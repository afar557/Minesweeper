Explain advanced inferrence
ask if we can use outside library to calc rref
Doesn't our advancedInferrence do basic as well?


# {A:,B:,C:,D:,E:,F:}

# stack: A
# {A:0,B:,C:1,D:1,E:,F:}

# stack:A,B
# {A:0,B:0,C:1,D:1,E:,F:}

does global info & better decisions part of the report only apply to improved or should those changes be made to both? 
if our rref was way slower, can we use library?
